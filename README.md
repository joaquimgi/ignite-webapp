# Ignite [Demo](http://joaquimgi.github.io/ignite-webapp)

A cool Webapp compiling all upcoming and existing games, updating via API calls made with React JS, Styled Components, Framer Motion animation and Redux. This website was made following a course from Dev Ed but with some refactoring from me to remove redundant code and adding a slider wiht fancy animation.
